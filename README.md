<h3 align="left">Dataset Used</h3>

The dataset is coming from New York City Taxmi and Limousine Commision (TLC), they are agency responsible for licensing & regulating taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, vans, paratransit vehicles. For-hired vehicles provide prearranged transportation services in NYC, these vehicles can't accept street hails & must schedule trips with passengers by phone / website / smartphone apps.

Type of services:
* Black cars
* App-based transportation: Uber / Lyft (This is referred as High Volume For-hired services, which I am interested in)
